         Release of version 0.01 of Attribute::Handlers::Prospective
==============================================================================


NAME
    Attribute::Handlers::Prospective - Enhanced definition of attribute handlers

DESCRIPTION
    This module, when inherited by a package, allows that package's class to
    define attribute handler subroutines for specific attributes. Variables
    and subroutines subsequently defined in that package, or in packages
    derived from that package may be given attributes with the same names as
    the attribute handler subroutines, which will then be called at the end
    of the compilation phase (i.e. in an INIT block).

EXAMPLE

	package UNIVERSAL;
	use Attribute::Handlers::Prospective;

	my %name;
	sub name { return $name{$_[2]}||*{$_[1]}{NAME} }

	sub Name    :ATTR(RAWDATA) {
		$name{$_[2]} = $_[4]
	}

	sub Purpose :ATTR(RAWDATA) {
		print STDERR "Purpose of ", &name, " is $_[4]\n"
	}

	sub Unit    :ATTR(RAWDATA) {
		print STDERR &name, " measured in $_[4]\n"
	}


	package main;

	my $capacity : Name(capacity)
		     : Purpose(to store max storage capacity for files)
		     : Unit(Gb);

	package Other;

	sub foo : Purpose(to foo all data before barring it) { }
